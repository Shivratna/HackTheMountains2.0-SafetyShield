# HackTheMountains2.0-SafetyShield
SafetyShield is an application that provides a safe environment for meetings and classes. The video conferencing platform in our application is named as VidSafe. This application would work best if it is installed by the organisation itself. It has some of the most essential features that are usually required in classes such as giving meeting insights and creating notes of what is being discussed in the class. SafetyShield not only provides these features but it also helps us prevent and report online harassment/abuse. While the speech-to-text conversion is being done, our app filters through the content and checks for the presence of any offensive words that do not belong in such environments. If it finds any, it immediately sends a mail to the college authorities with the name of the person who has said something offensive along with the details of what they have said. This helps us nip online harassment in the bud. There are two ways in which you can use our application: 1. It can be used as a video conferencing platform and the safety feature comes in-built. 2. It can be used along with other video conferencing platforms too.
